# Classification

[TOC]

## Overview  

### what is classification

* Qualitative variables take values in an unordered set $\mathcal{C}$, such as:
  * Eye color $\in$ {brwon, blue, green}
  * email $\in$ {spam, ham}
* Given a feature vector $X$ and a qualitative response $Y$ taking values in the set $\mathcal{C}$ the classification task is to build a function $C(X)$ that takes as input the feature vector $X$ and predicts its value for $Y$; i.e. $C(X)\in\mathcal{C}$
* Often we are more interested in estimating the <span style="color:green">probabilities</span> that $X$ belongs tp each category in $\mathcal{C}$.
