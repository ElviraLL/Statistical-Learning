## Simple Linear Regression
### What Is Linear Regression
   - Linear regression is a simple approach to supervised learning. 
   - Assumption: Y depends on X linearly.
   - True regression functions are never linear
   - Simple model is very good.
### Simple linear regression using a single predictor X
   - We assume a model $$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon $$
   Where $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are two unknown constants that represent the <font color=‘red’>intercept</font> and <font color=‘red’>slop</font>, also known as <font color=‘red’>coefficients</font> or <font color=‘red’>parameters</font>, and $\epsilon$ is the error term
   - Given some estimates $\hat{\beta_0}$ and $\hat{\beta_1}$ for the model coefficients, we predict future sales using $$\hat{y} = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1}x,$$
   where $\hat{y}$ indicates a prediction of $Y$ on the basis of $X=x$. The <font color=‘red’>hat</font> symbol denotes and estimated value.
